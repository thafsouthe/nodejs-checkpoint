## ✅ Tasks Completed

### 1. Hello World

- File: `hello-world.js`

### 2. Web Server

- File: `server.js`
- Runs a Node.js server on `localhost:3000` and responds with an HTML message.

### 3. File System Operations

- File: `file-system.js`
- Creates `welcome.txt` and reads contents of `hello.txt`.

### 4. Password Generator

- File: `password-generator.js`
- Uses [`generate-password`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generate-password) to create a random password.

### 5. Email Sender

- File: `email-sender.js`
- Uses [`nodemailer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer) to send an email.
- ⚠️ Make sure to **remove or hide personal credentials** before sharing or uploading this file.
